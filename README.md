We will now use the JSP skills you learned to build a Web UI to your To Do List application.

Description:
Create a new project and make sure you add the items in the past modules such as, Hibernate, The Todo List objects, etc. Add a web UI, so that it runs on the Tomcat web server. You will have to add JSP code for each of the web pages (show to-do list, add a to-do item, delete a to-do item). Your to-do-list application should already be well structured, separating the back-end from the front-end, so that adding a web UI is just a matter of adding a new front-end which would call the existing back-end.
